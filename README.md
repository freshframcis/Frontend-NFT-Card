## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

For a responsive page flexbox or grid should be used as it allows texts to wrap around when the page is resized. I understood how to play around with flexbox and oter css properties. I used the three types of styling here. This has helped me to build my confidence in css. Though i know it isn't a good practice to use an inline styling for refrence sake i decided to use it, but i know the code might look a little cumbersome. 

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```


### Continued development

Flexbox and grid are of outmost important to me when it comes css. I hope to improve on this two properties as i continue to journey to perfection in using css.
